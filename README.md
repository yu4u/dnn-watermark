Embedding Watermarks into Deep Neural Networks
====
This code is the implementation of "Embedding Watermarks into Deep Neural Networks" [1]. It embeds a digital watermark into deep neural networks in training the host network. This embedding is achieved by a parameter regularizer.

This README will be updated later for more details.

## Requirements
Keras 1.1.2 (<1.2.0), tensorflow 0.12.1 (<1.0.0), numpy, matplotlib, pandas

 **[CAUTION]**
We found that custom regularizers had been deprecated in the latest versions of Keras as discussed [here](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/4703).

> Custom regularizers may no longer work.

Therefore please use the old versions of Keras and TensorFlow.
(keras 1.1.2 does not work on tensorflow >= 1.0.)

```sh
pip install keras==1.1.2
pip install tensorflow==0.12.1
pip install tensorflow-gpu==0.12.1
```

### Docker
Launch the Docker container:
```sh
docker/launch.sh
```
To avoid downloading the dataset each time the container is launched, specify the path to the local dataset in `DATASET_DIR` in `launch.sh`.

## Usage
Embed a watermark in training a host network:

```sh
# train the host network while embedding a watermark
python train_wrn.py config/train_random_min.json

# extract the embedded watermark
python utility/wmark_validate.py result/wrn_WTYPE_random_DIM256_SCALE0.01_N1K4B64EPOCH3_TBLK1.weight result/wrn_WTYPE_random_DIM256_SCALE0.01_N1K4B64EPOCH3_TBLK1_layer7_w.npy result/random
```

Train the host network *without* embedding:

```sh
# train the host network without embedding
python train_wrn.py config/train_non_min.json 

# extract the embedded watermark (meaningless because no watermark was embedded)
python utility/wmark_validate.py result/wrn_WTYPE_random_DIM256_SCALE0.01_N1K4B64EPOCH3_TBLK0.weight result/wrn_WTYPE_random_DIM256_SCALE0.01_N1K4B64EPOCH3_TBLK1_layer7_w.npy result/non

# visualize the embedded watermark
python utility/draw_histogram_signature.py config/draw_histogram_non.json hist_signature_non.png
```

Extracted watermarks from the embedded host network and the non-embedded networks:
